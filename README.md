# Sara's django issue tracker 

## Overview 
This project focuses on incorporating django, in order to provide front-end users with the ability to raise issue tickets, or purchase new feature tickets for an app.

## UX and UI

## Features
 
- Chart.js
    * Previously I had stated that I wanted to delve further when using Javascript, therefore I chose chart.js to display the charts on this website. This allowed me to not only experiment with Javascript, but also experience using scripts in a different manner, such as directly within a HTML document. 
- FontAwesome
    * Used to display icons.
- Ability for users to interact with the owners of the website via social media
    * In the future I would like to expand on this feature, and allow users to be sent directly to the website's social media pages.


### Features left to implement

> Front-end features
- Give users the ability to edit their issues and add comments
    * I initially was working on a function that would enable users to edit an issue they may have add, but due to time restraints I decided this would be something that would be better to work on in the future. 
- Allow users to leave feedback 
    * Currently feedback is hardcoded. However, in the future I would like to learn how to develop a real feedback section for users, as well as have snippets of this feedback presented on the progress page. 

> Back-end features
- Gain a general better understanding of what Django is capable of 
    * Experiment with Django admin and models 
- Learn more about the use of slugs

## Testing techniques

### Manual testing
* A lot of manual testing has been implemented during the building stage of this project. Chrome’s responsive web tester was used in order to ensure the website was responsive on different devices as well as various screen sizes. The website was also tested on various browsers.

* W3C was also used to validate the code.

## Deployment
Github and Heroku were used for the deployment of this project.

## Credits

A bootstrap theme has been used and modified in order to take advantage of its sidebar feature.

Certain pieces of code were learnt from tutorials from ‘CodingEntrepreneurs’.
